# Project Pillars

## Core Principles for Image Generation System

### 1. Consistency First
**Goal**: Maintain consistent visual style across all generated images
- Use fixed prompts and parameters
- Avoid style drift through version control
- Prioritize reproducibility over variety

### 2. Child-Safe Design
**Goal**: Ensure all content is appropriate for toddlers
- Warm, friendly visual style
- Simple, recognizable objects
- No scary or complex imagery

### 3. Automation Ready
**Goal**: Design for batch processing and minimal manual intervention
- Clear input/output pipelines
- Error handling and recovery
- Progress tracking and logging

### 4. Quality Over Quantity
**Goal**: Generate high-quality assets suitable for production
- Centered composition
- Clean backgrounds
- Consistent sizing and framing

### 5. Flexibility in Implementation
**Goal**: Support multiple generation backends
- OpenAI for quick cloud results
- Stable Diffusion for local control
- Extensible architecture for future models

### 6. User-Friendly Operation
**Goal**: Make the system accessible to non-technical users
- Clear documentation
- Simple command-line interface
- Future web UI for broader access

### 7. Cost Efficiency
**Goal**: Optimize for reasonable API costs
- Batch processing strategies
- Local alternatives when viable
- Usage monitoring and limits
