- **Tech**: SD 1.5, ControlNet, PyTorch, Custom LoRA
- **Status**: ❌ Abandoned
- **Notes**: Results were unacceptable for children's content. SD generated complex scenes with multiple objects despite clear prompts. Quality far below DALL-E 3 output. Decision made to focus exclusively on OpenAI pipeline. Completed 2024-12-29

### [TASK-001]: Fixed Vision Workflow in openai_image_generator.py
- **Desc**: Corrected the GPT-4 Vision → DALL-E workflow to properly use ChatGPT analysis
- **Tech**: OpenAI GPT-4V, DALL-E 3, prompt engineering
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Notes**: Fixed process_single_image() to actually use analyze_image() method, separated vision_analysis_prompt from dalle_wrapper_prompt, added proper prompt wrapping mechanism. Impact: Enables intelligent, context-aware image generation. Completed 2025-06-02

### [TASK-002]: Removed Background Removal from Pipeline
- **Desc**: Cleaned up automatic background removal functionality, manual Canva workflow preferred
- **Tech**: rembg removal, config cleanup, code simplification
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Notes**: Removed rembg import and remove_background() method, cleaned up save_image_from_url() logic, removed background_removal config sections. Impact: Simplified pipeline, better quality control via manual processing. Completed 2025-06-02

### [TASK-003]: Fixed Proxy Error in Vision Workflow

- **Tech**: OpenAI client initialization, httpx proxy handling
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Notes**: Added try/catch with fallback to httpx.Client(trust_env=False), handles "unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'" error. Impact: Vision workflow fully operational across different network configurations. Completed 2025-06-02

### [TASK-004]: Enhanced Nested Folder Support in Vision Workflow

### [TASK-005]: Parallel Processing Architecture Implementation
- **Desc**: Implemented optimal parallel worker system for maximum API throughput while managing rate limits
- **Tech**: Python threading, queue management, staggered processing, OpenAI API optimization
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Notes**: Created pipelined system progressing from 2→3→4→3 workers to find optimal balance. Final TRIPLE THREAT configuration: 3 workers with round-robin distribution (W1: 1,4,7..., W2: 2,5,8..., W3: 3,6,9...). Each worker handles complete GPT-4V analysis → DALL-E generation workflow. Staggered startup (0s, 3s, 6s) prevents initial rate limiting. Removed artificial rate limiting for pure API speed testing. Found 4 workers hit rate limits consistently, 3 workers optimal for maximum throughput without rate limit spam. Impact: Dramatically improved batch processing performance for 100+ images. Completed 2025-06-02

### [LOOP-001]: Configurable Loop Image Processor
- **Desc**: Created dedicated loop processing system that runs 2-worker pipeline in linear chain iterations with configurable start/end points
- **Tech**: Python threading, queue management, dedicated config system, linear chain processing
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Notes**: Built `src/loop_processor.py` with dedicated `config/loop_processor_config.json`. Features: configurable start_loop (resume capability), always ends at loop 10, linear chain processing (Loop 1: base→1, Loop 2: 1→2, etc.), 2-worker pipeline with 3s offset, separate config prevents interference with main processor. Impact: Enables iterative AI evolution experiments with cost control (80 total images vs exponential growth). Completed 2025-01-30

### [ANIM-001]: Evolution Animation Creator
- **Desc**: Created comprehensive animation system to visualize AI evolution chains from loop processor output
- **Tech**: PIL/Pillow, animated GIF creation, grid montage generation, filename pattern matching
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Notes**: Built `scripts/create_evolution_animation.py` with `create_evolution_animation.bat` launcher. Features: auto-discovery of evolution chains, 11-frame animations (original + L1→L10), animated GIFs with configurable speed/size, grid montages for side-by-side comparison, filename fixing utility for consistent naming. Includes `scripts/fix_loop_filenames.py` for cleaning inconsistent naming patterns. Impact: Enables visual analysis of AI interpretation evolution across iterations. Completed 2025-01-30
