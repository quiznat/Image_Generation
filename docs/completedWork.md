- **Tech**: Python venv, pip, markdown
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Notes**: Core dependencies installed, documentation structure established, ready for pipeline testing. Completed 2024-12-29

### [IMG-004]: LoRA Training Documentation and Scripts
- **Desc**: Created comprehensive training guide and scripts for custom LoRA models
- **Tech**: Python, diffusers, accelerate, PyTorch
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Notes**: Created training_guide.md, prepare_training_data.py, train_lora.py, and quick_start_guide.md. Documentation consolidated into main README. Completed 2024-12-29

### [DOC-001]: Documentation Consolidation
- **Desc**: Consolidated multiple README files (training_guide.md, SD_Pipeline_README.md, quick_start_guide.md, PROJECT_STARTUP.md, Image_README.md) into one comprehensive README.md
- **Tech**: Markdown, documentation structure
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Notes**: Removed redundant files, created single source of truth, improved discoverability. Completed 2024-12-29

### [TRAIN-001]: LoRA Training Data Preparation
- **Desc**: Prepared 138 training images from test/assets subdirectories, created captions, generated metadata
- **Tech**: PIL, Python scripts, prepare_all_training_data.py
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Notes**: Processed Building_Bonanza, Farmyard_Friends, and other categories. Resized to 512x512, created individual caption files. Completed 2024-12-29

### [TRAIN-002]: LoRA Training Dependencies Setup
- **Desc**: Installed PyTorch 2.3.1+cu118, diffusers from source, resolved dependency conflicts
- **Tech**: PyTorch, diffusers, accelerate, xformers, NumPy
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Notes**: Resolved xformers compatibility, downgraded NumPy to 1.26.4, installed from diffusers git source. Training environment ready. Completed 2024-12-29

### [BUG-001]: OpenAI Client Proxy Initialization Error
- **Desc**: Fixed "Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'" error in OpenAI pipeline
- **Tech**: OpenAI 1.12.0, httpx, Python
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Notes**: Issue caused by system proxy environment variables. Fixed by using httpx.Client(trust_env=False) to ignore proxy settings. Completed 2024-12-29

### [IMG-002]: Validate OpenAI Image Generation Pipeline
- **Desc**: Test and validate the OpenAI DALL-E image generation pipeline
- **Tech**: OpenAI API, DALL-E 3, openai_image_generator_v2_simple.py
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Notes**: Successfully generated 138 test images from test/assets subdirectories. Fixed proxy issue first, then completed full generation run. Images maintain crayon-style consistency. Completed 2024-12-29

### [IMG-005]: Train Custom LoRA Model
- **Desc**: Trained crayon-style LoRA model on 138 prepared images from test/assets subdirectories
- **Tech**: diffusers, accelerate, PyTorch 2.3.1+cu118, xformers
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Notes**: Training completed successfully after 2h 14min (1000 steps, final loss=0.0476). Model saved to ./models/crayon_lora_20250601_210321. Ready for use with SD pipeline. Completed 2024-12-29

### [IMG-003]: Stable Diffusion Pipeline Evaluation
- **Desc**: Tested SD 1.5 with and without LoRA for crayon-style generation
- **Tech**: SD 1.5, ControlNet, PyTorch, Custom LoRA
- **Status**: ❌ Abandoned
- **Notes**: Results were unacceptable for children's content. SD generated complex scenes with multiple objects despite clear prompts. Quality far below DALL-E 3 output. Decision made to focus exclusively on OpenAI pipeline. Completed 2024-12-29
