# Current Task

## Active Work

_No active tasks. Vision-enhanced OpenAI pipeline is fully operational and validated._

## Next Steps

Consider:
1. **Quality comparison** between v1 (vision-based) vs v2_simple (filename-based) outputs
2. **Performance benchmarking** - measure cost and speed differences between workflows
3. **Hybrid approach** - use v1 for failed v2 generations or complex objects
4. **Batch processing optimization** for large-scale generation (100+ images)
5. **Automated quality checks** for generated images
6. **Web interface** for easier interaction (Streamlit/FastAPI)
7. **Cost tracking and optimization** features
