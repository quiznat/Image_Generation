## Recently Completed

### [TASK-005]: Parallel Processing Architecture Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- **Desc**: Implemented optimal parallel worker system for maximum API throughput while managing rate limits
- **Tech**: Python threading, queue management, staggered processing, OpenAI API optimization
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Notes**: 
  - ✅ **Evolution**: 2→3→4→3 workers to find optimal balance
  - ✅ **TRIPLE THREAT**: 3 workers with round-robin distribution (W1: 1,4,7..., W2: 2,5,8..., W3: 3,6,9...)
  - ✅ **Complete Workflow**: Each worker handles GPT-4V analysis → DALL-E generation
  - ✅ **Staggered Startup**: 0s, 3s, 6s intervals prevent initial rate limiting
  - ✅ **Rate Limit Discovery**: Removed artificial delays for pure API speed testing
  - ✅ **Optimal Configuration**: 4 workers hit rate limits, 3 workers = sweet spot
  - ✅ **Production Ready**: `openai_image_generator_pipelined.py` + `run_image_generator_pipelined.bat`

## Next Steps

Consider:
1. **Production Testing** - Run TRIPLE THREAT on large batches (100+ images) to validate performance
2. **Performance Benchmarking** - Compare pipelined vs sequential processing times with real data
3. **Queue Persistence** - Add ability to resume interrupted pipeline processing
4. **Hybrid Batch Processing** - Combine pipelined V1 with V2 simple for different use cases
5. **Web Interface** - Streamlit dashboard for pipeline monitoring and control
6. **Cost Analysis** - Track API costs and generate cost reports for different worker configurations
7. **Auto-scaling** - Dynamic worker count based on API response times and rate limit detection
